# EncryptionDecryptionExample
Sample Demo App to encrypt &amp; decrypt the data.

The server side implementation as shown in screenshot below is need to be done on server side (using encryption algorithm in AESHelper class) . The server side code is not present in demo, it's just a hint to view how client side decrypts encrypted data received from server.
